I am a postdoctoral researcher in [https://ieor.berkeley.edu/ Industrial Engineering & Operations Research Department] at Univeristy of California, Berkeley advised by Professor [https://xinguo.ieor.berkeley.edu/ Xin Guo]. I obtained my Ph.~D. in the Department of [https://orfe.princeton.edu Operations Research and Financial Engineering] at Princeton University supervised by Professor [http://www.columbia.edu/~dl3133/ Daniel Lacker] and Professor [http://mykhaylo.princeton.edu/ Mykhaylo Shkolnikov] in 2021. Prior to these, I received my bachelor's degree in Math from Tsinghua University in 2016. \n\n
 
I can be contacted at jiachengz \[at\] berkeley \[dot\] edu \n
Here is my [./CV/Resume.pdf CV]. \n\n

My research focus lies in the theory of probability and stochastic optimization. I have worked on stochastic partial differential equations, especially Mckean-Vlasov type equation, partial differential equations, mathematical finance like stochastic portfolio theory and stochastic volatility modeling in the past few years. \n\n
