I am a fifth year Ph.~D.~candidate in the Department of [https://orfe.princeton.edu Operations Research and Financial Engineering] at [https://www.princeton.edu Princeton University] supervised by Prof. [http://www.columbia.edu/~dl3133/ Daniel Lacker] and Prof. [http://mykhaylo.princeton.edu/ Mykhaylo Shkolnikov]. I received my bachelor's degree in Math from Tsinghua University in 2016. \n\n
 
I can be contacted at jiacheng \[at\] princeton \[dot\] edu \n
Here is my [./CV/Resume.pdf CV]. \n\n

My research focus lies in the theory of probability. I have worked on stochastic partial differential equations, especially Mckean-Vlasov type equation, partial differential equations, mathematical finance like stochastic portfolio theory and stochastic volatility modeling in the past few years. \n\n
